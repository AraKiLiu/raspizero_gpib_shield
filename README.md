# raspizero_gpib_shield
A GPIB shield for the raspberry pi zero

Connecting GPIB-capable lab equipment to your PC nowadays is mostly a choice between several USB-to-GPIB adapters. If your platform of choice is linux, especially the Raspberry Pi, then you may run into trouble getting some of the proprietary adapters up and running.



The Raspberry Pi shield was created to solve this problem.

This repository contains the following:
1, the schematics for the raspberry-pi-zero GPIB shield
2, a stl file for a 3d-printable mounting bracket

This shield is meant to be used with the raspi_gpib_driver (https://github.com/elektronomikon/raspi_gpib_driver)
